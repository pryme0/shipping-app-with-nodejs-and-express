HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS
-First install nodejs,mongodb and git bash
-After installing mongodb create a folder in the installation path and name it data
-Inside the data folder create another folder and name it db
-Then open a command prompt and navigate to the folder where mongodb was installed and use the command "mongod" to get mongodb started(e.g cd program files\mongodb\server\3.2\bin)
-if you are running a 32 bit system you will have to specify the storage engine and data path using this command...mongod --storageEngine=mmapv1 --dbpath="c:\program files\data\db"...(note you will replace the db path with the location of your data folder)
-After mongodb is up and running Navigate to the folder where you unzipped the app and git bash there(this is assuming you already have gitbash installed ...
right click on the folder you will see the git bash option) when you git bash a command prompt will pop up
-in the command prompt that pops up type in the command("nodemon start") without the bracces wait a minute or two you will see a mesage that says your app is running on port 5000
-go to your browser and type localhost:5000 you will be taken to the index page of the application.
